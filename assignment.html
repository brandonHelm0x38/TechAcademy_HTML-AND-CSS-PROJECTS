			<h3>Swords to Ploughshares</h3>
			<p>A concept created in the bible which was very popular after WW2.  It's a metaphor and a call to action.  
			The mataphor and call both describe the act of taking efforts to make weapons, and converting them to efforts to make life easier, or more prosperous.</p>
			<h4>There are several popular statues that were created after WW2 to memorialize the importance of this pivot.</h4>
