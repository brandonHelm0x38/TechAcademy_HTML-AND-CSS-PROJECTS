			<h4>Article Posted: <time datetime="2025-12-23">December 23rd, 2025</time></h4>
			<p>Government Efficiency can never achieve it's potential as a government alone run entity, and instead requires a complex fusion of the private and public sectors. 
			Projects and contracts are all supported by the private sector, and we need to make interactive channels to build a culture of continual process improvement.</p>

				<p>We need a "Businesses Bill of Rights" which outlines how we will create, collaborate on, and manage our National Computing Infrastructure. 
				The most important infrastructure we can target is education transcript records.  This is because a key part in process improvement, is vetting whom has skills and credible ideas worth listening to. 
				<br><br>
				As it stands, we only credit people who go through specific programs, and we throw the majority of books and independent learning aside. 
				Additionally, education could be expanded so greatly, that as we set national priorities... real world challenges can be broken down into their elements in the exact ways complex teams set out to accomplish complex endeavors. 
				This will radically revolutionize how interactive education can be made. 
				<br><br>
				A critical feature to go after for this technological initiative... is a 3D concept mapping engine. 
				With that... an interested user or concerned citizen could click on a post in this specilized social media interface, and get a map to succeeding at learning about that issue... with all intriciacies modeled between the complexities of the subject. 
				This becomes like an interactive team playbook... because getting involved and "making a play" means proving you have certain skills and developing a unique approach to a solution. 
				<br><br>
				Thats what we need to stay focused on... proving we understand and appreciate the work we each are doing and thoroughly mapping differences in strategy.  The truth is that going after an education toolkit with these features, will improve collaboration on every Open-Source and inter-corporate endeavor.</p>
