				<p>His kids eyes are <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">green</span>. His wife's eyes are <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">blue</span>. However, his eyes are <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold;">brown</span>.</p>
				<p>I'm breaking up the following poem using line break, from inside a single 'p' element.<br>
				<br>
				No man is an island,<br>
				<br>
				Entire of itself,<br>
				<br>
				Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
				<br>
				A part of the main.<br>
				<br>
				If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
				<br>
				Europe is the less.<br>
				<br>
				As well as if a promontory were.<br>
				<br>
				As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
				<br>
				Or of thine own were:<br>
				<br>
				Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
				<br>
				Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
				<br>
				And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
				<br>
				It tolls for thee.<br>
				<br>
				I wrote this at 4:00&nbsp;p.m.<br>
				The above time will never break on a single line because I used a non-breaking space to separate the text.
